# OOP Game Show App
## Teamtreehouse - FSJS Techdegree Unit 4 Project
A phrase guessing game where the player tries to reveal a hidden phrase by selecting letters that are in the phrase. The player can only guess a letter incorrectly a limited number of times before the player looses.

### Extra credit requirement 2: Making the project your own.
Added transitional styling to the win and lose classes so the win/lose overlay fades into being displayed.

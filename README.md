# OOP Game Show App
## Teamtreehouse - FSJS Techdegree Unit 4 Project
A phrase guessing game where the player tries to reveal a hidden phrase by selecting letters that are in the phrase. The player can only guess a letter incorrectly a limited number of times before the player looses.

### Extra credit requirement 2: Making the project your own.
    I added a setTimeout function to the gameOver method in order to allow the player to visually see the last letter they chose, and if they lost, the removed heart. I also prevented the user from interacting with the onscreen or user keyboard during this time.
